## Theme

The conference theme is "Perl in the cloud". The goal is to have days of
conference, with two tracks: One for generic Perl talks and one for web
development, with focus on Mojolicious.

We are [working](https://github.com/oslo-pm/NPW2018/issues/8) on getting
speakers for the conference.
[We](/npw2018/2018/04/19/npw2018-call-for-papers.html) would love if you would
like to give a talk!

## How to get to Oslo

Coming from abroad? Oslo has two airports:

* The main Oslo Airport, [Gardermoen](http://osl.no) (OSL) is the most
  convenient way to get into Oslo. The cheapest way to Oslo is by 
  [regular train](https://www.nsb.no/bestill/velg-togavgang?to=Oslo+S&from=Oslo+Lufthavn). 
  The ticket gives free transfer to busses, trams and metro in Oslo. It is also possible
  to use the expensive [airport express train](http://flytoget.no/), if you want to save
  a couple of minutes. 

* You can get to Oslo from [Torp Airport](https://www.torp.no/) (TRF) by 
  [bus](http://torpekspressen.no/). The bus trip takes about 90 minutes. 
  Torp offers low-cost flights.

## Travel and lodging

There are [many places](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?dest_id=-273837;dest_type=city)
to choose from in Oslo. Here are some suggestions:

* [Radisson Blu Scandinavia](https://www.radissonblu.com/en/scandinaviahotel-oslo)

* [Smarthotell Oslo](https://smarthotel.no/en/)

* [Citybox](https://citybox.no/oslo-en/)

* [Edderkoppen](https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/norway/oslo/scandic-stolavsplass)

* [Hotel Bondeheimen](http://www.bondeheimen.com/)
