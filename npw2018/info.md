## Theme

The conference theme is "Perl in the cloud". The goal is to have days of
conference, with two tracks: One for generic Perl talks and one for web
development, with focus on Mojolicious.

We are [working](https://github.com/oslo-pm/NPW2018/issues/8) on getting
speakers for the conference. [We](/npw2018/call-for-papers) would love if you would
like to give a talk!

## How to get to Oslo

Coming from abroad? Oslo has two airports close by, that you can fly to.

* You can get to Oslo from [Torp](https://www.torp.no/) (TRF) by taking the
  [bus](http://torpekspressen.no/). Torp offer low-budget flights from many
  places in Europe.

* The main Oslo airport, [Gardermoen](http://osl.no) (OSL) is the most
  convenient way to get into Oslo. You can either take the
  [airport express train](http://flytoget.no/) for the fastest and most
  reliable route, or the
  [regular train](https://www.nsb.no/bestill/velg-togavgang?to=Oslo+S&from=Oslo+Lufthavn)
  for a lower price.

## Directions to the venue

We are working on [finding a venue](https://github.com/oslo-pm/NPW2018/issues/1)
for the conference.

## Travel and lodging

There are [many places](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.en-gb.html?dest_id=-273837;dest_type=city)
to choose from in Oslo. Here are some suggestions:

* [Anker Hotel](http://anker-hotel.no/)

* [Citybox](https://citybox.no/oslo-en/)

* [Edderkoppen](https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/norway/oslo/scandic-stolavsplass)

* [Hotel Bondeheimen](http://www.bondeheimen.com/)
