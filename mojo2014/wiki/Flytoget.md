<h1>  Mojoconf 2014 - Wiki - Flytoget  </h1>  <p>I would recommend this: Go from the plane, get your luggage, go to the machine where you can get Airport shuttle tickets swipe my card and enter the train. It's 170 NOK compared to 150 NOK with the bus (regular price). Buy tickets from the &quot;Flytoget&quot; (orange logo) machine and not &quot;NSB&quot; (red logo). The reason is that Flytoget goes every ten minutes and only takes 19 minutes to get to Oslo. That means more Mojoconf and less waiting for the train.</p>
