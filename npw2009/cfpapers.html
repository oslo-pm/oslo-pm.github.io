<h2>Call for Papers - Nordic Perl Workshop 2009</h2>  <div style="padding: 2em; border: 2px solid red;"><strong>Deadline extended!</strong> <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/npw2009/newtalk"">Submit your talk before Jan. 18th!</a></div>

<p>Attention Speakers!</p>

<p>Nordic Perl Workshop 2009 will be held in Oslo, on April 16th and 17th .</p>

<p>It will be held together with <a href="http://www.goopen.no/index.php?sideID=76&amp;ledd1=26">Go Open 2009</a>, a conference aiming to help and facilitate the use of open source in the public and private sectors. Together we will have five tracks (three technical), and we expect more than 700 participants. We will also try to arrange a Rakudo hackaton on the weekend after the conference.</p>
<p>This workshop's topic is "Your future with Perl". We're interested in hearing about your talks on these topics:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Perl 6, Rakudo, Parrot</li>
    <li>Modern use of Perl</li>
    <li>Good testing practices using Perl</li>
    <li>Perl used in new and novel ways</li>
    <li>Your Favourite Topic? (systems administration / life sciences / web development)</li>
</ul>

<p>We accept these presentation types:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extended Talks (90 minutes)</li>
    <li>Standard Talks (45 minutes)</li>
    <li><strong>NEW:</strong> Short Talks (20 minutes)</li>
    <li>Lightning Talks (5 minutes)</li>
</ul>

<p>There will also be opportunity for Birds-of-a-Feather sessions during the workshop. If you want to attend the workshop as a speaker, please send an abstract of your talk - see the submission section below for details.</p>

<h2>Standard and Short Talks</h2>

<p>A standard talk is the preferred format. This gives enough time to introduce a topic, presenting it with some slides and a coverage of the main points leadingup to later, hopefully more in-depth, discussions (possibly at a BOF). For special subjects which require more time, we may schedule an Extended Talk instead. If you really can't fill the full 45 minutes, feel free to submit a short talk.</p>

<h2>Lightning Talks</h2>

<p>Lightning talks are brief talks that focus on a single example, idea, project, or technique. The purpose is not to cover all aspects of the respective topics, but rather to present a facet of the idea clearly and succinctly. Lightning talks are an excellent forum for first-time speakers. Due to the time-constraint on lightning talks (5 min), we recommend that you either abstain from using slides, or have a presentation setup that you can set up in just a few seconds. In addition, we recommend that you bring a backup of your slides on a USB drive, or have it available on a website.</p>

<p>To submit a proposal for a lightning talk, please register your talk at <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/npw2009/newtalk">http://act.yapc.eu/npw2009/newtalk</a> with your proposed title and an abstract of up to four sentences. It is also possible to hand in a proposal at the conference registration, but we prefer to know of your talk in advance.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>To submit a proposal for a talk/presentation, please register your proposed title and an abstract on <a href="http://act.yapc.eu/npw2009/newtalk">http://act.yapc.eu/npw2009/newtalk</a>.</p>

<p>Submissions are due midnight (23:59 CET) on January 18th 2009. Submitters will be notified within two weeks whether or not their talks have been accepted. If your proposal is accepted, you will be expected to confirm within 48 hours that you in fact will give the talk; otherwise, your slot may be given to someone else.</p>

<p>If you have something which does not fit the formats listed please feel free to contact us anyway and we will evaluate it.</p>

<p>Please include the following with your abstract(s):</p>

<ul>
    <li>A little information about yourself (and possibly an link to an image of your choosing - preferably of yourself).</li>
    <li>An indication of preferred language and possible languages the presentation can be given in.</li>
    <li>The expected minimum level of knowledge of your target audience (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)</li>
    <li>An indication of the length of the presentation.</li>
    <li>A listing of any requirements you might have for doing your presentation. We will try to accommodate your request. Projectors and internet connection will be available for all talks.</li>
</ul>

<p>If possible, please include a link to your slides/paper ready for online publishing. The files are also accepted just after talk ends, so we can include any last minute modifications.</p>

<p>We take the liberty of filming presentations. If you are not interested in being filmed during your presentation, please let us know in advance.</p>
