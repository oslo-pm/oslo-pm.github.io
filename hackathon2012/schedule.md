We'll spend the evening talking with the new guys, planning the weekend and catch up with the others. Maybe later we'll go to a pub for some tasty goodness, or just hang out in the lobby of the hotel where pmichaud is staying.

* Remember: Meet at 18:00.
* Remember: *If you can't come*, send us a mail! p6hackathon@perlworkshop.no

## Saturday 21st, 10:00-*:

Hacking at Redpill Linpro's venue. Oslo.pm organizes lunch, and some Pizza for dinner. We'll stay for as long as we need (within some building security-related limits), and perhaps visit a pub in the evening.

* Remember: Bring your laptop.
* Remember: Make sure everything is set up before the hackathon!

Sometime during the day we'll get a visit from [Oslo Coding Dojo](http://www.meetup.com/OsloCodingDojo/). [They'll show us how to do a Coding Dojo](http://code.foo.no/2012/04/18/coding-dojos), and we'll be able to test out Perl 6 with this. The Dojo is all about learning good programming habits while having fun - something we can bring with us to other conferences and Perl Mongers meetings? :)

* Remember: Bring your laptop.

## Sunday 22nd, 10:00-17:00ish:

Hacking at Redpill Linpro's venue. Oslo.pm organizes lunch. Some attendees will be leaving, the rest of us have the evening off, for further hacking or joining the Go Open conference crowd social event for some food at 18:00.

* Remember: Bring your laptop.
* Remember: Take some notes about what you've done, so you can blog about it later!
