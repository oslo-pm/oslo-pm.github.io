## Braindump of questions for the hackathon attendees

* How/Why is Perl6 radically different from other languages?
 * How do we tell this?
 * Are there any/What are the scientific papers/research that Perl 6 builds on?
* Why does Perl 6 development take a long time?
 * Why are there too few developers?
  * Has the Perl 6 development process been too complicated?
  * What can be done to make it easier for new developers to join?
  * Has the documentation/specification been too much oriented towards current Perl 6 developers, rather than to external users?
 * What should we do to actively reach/recruit more developers?
* How will a future with Perl 6 look like?
 * How do we get to this future?
* What does it mean for me, as a programmer, that Perl 6 is released?
 * How do I learn Perl 6?
 * What software/modules can I make use of?
 * What infrastructure do I have available?
  * What should this infrastructure look like?
   * Should there be more "official" frameworks, or should we keep embracing timtowdy? How much should we focus on the former or allow the latter?
* Why the high ambitions with Perl 6?
 * Can we use these ambitions in any new ways?
 * How do we share these ambitions? How do we explain their reason?
 * How do we use these ambitions for a marketing purpose?
 * How do we convey the differences between Perl 6 and other languages?
 * What are the killer arguments for why people should switch to Perl 6?
* How might the Perl 6 language features influence the way we write programs? (e.g. features like roles, grammars, gradual typing, multis, junctions, terseness, meta*operators)
 * How can we make binary bindings (c libraries) more accesible?
 * How can we make "Write once, use on any VM" a reality?
 * How can we show use of all these new features?
 * How do we teach these concepts well?
 * What do we have to do to establish a notion of "Idiomatic Perl 6"? "Perl 6 patterns"? "Perl 6 by example"?
* How to do we communicate the Perl 6 revolution?
 * Do we need a Perl 6 marketing group?
 * How can we get Perl 6 more into research and development communities?
 * How can we make Perl 6 the natural choice for learning scripting languages?
 * What tag lines should we use? (cf. Java had "write once, run everywhere")
 * Are there other ways of presenting information about the language and software, that would make it easier for new users?
