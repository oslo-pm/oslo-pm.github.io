## About the hackathon

What does one do at a hackathon? The short answer is * ;). The long
answer: Whatever is necessary, interesting, fun or useful to do when you
get an opportunity to work with someone in the same room as yourself.
It's useful to have some opportunities to handle issues that require
high- bandwidth communication, and hackathons are one of those. You'll
also get opportunities to meet core Perl 6 hackers and learn or improve
your knowledge of the language.

As for the topic, it's a guideline. We as organizers would like to see
more people hack on Perl 6-related projects, and have realized that it
would be useful to spend some attention on making it easier to recruit
new people. This might mean we spend some time making cool examples to
use in promotional material, to look for patterns in the language that
can be used to make it easier to teach Perl 6, or to create the words
and images that let people recognize we have something utterly cool
going on in the Perl 6 community.

We want Perl 6 to be understandable and easily teachable to both
students and experienced developers and teachers. We'd love to spend
some time improving this aspect of the language.

If you'd like to participate, register above! :)

And failing that, remember: Do something cool, and tell about it! :D
