Change your language!</i></b></p> <p><i>No programming language is perfect. Whether you develop in PHP or Perl, Python or Java, Scala or sh, Clojure or Cobol, there's something about your devlang that you find awkward and ungainly and difficult -- some misfeature (or missing feature) that makes your job unnecessarily harder. Some construct or constraint that irritates you beyond all reason.</i></p> <p><i>The grass often looks greener on the other side. You hear people raving about Haskell or Scala or Erlang or Groovy or Perl 6, and you wonder whether it might be better to migrate to one of those brave new worlds.</i></p> <p><i>But to change your environment, you don't always have to change planets. Most of the time, it's vastly easier and more effective just to improve your existing planet.</i></p> <p><i>In this talk, Damian will look at four major annoyances and blockers in one of his own favorite languages (Perl 5), and explain how he went about converting them into features and enablers...just by writing a little more Perl.</i></p> <p>This will be an entertaining and insightful talk by one of the worlds very greatest communicators in programming. Although presented from a Perl point of view, the topics discussed apply to programming in any language in general.</p> <p>Entrance is free and open for all. Food and drinks will be sold at the bar. If you want food, we recommend you come early to get served before the talk starts.</p> <p><br/>There will also be a talk by Damian on Friday the 22nd: <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/230167281/\">Damian Conway at UiO: Perl 6 - More Concurrency, Less Contusion</a>.</p>","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/230165754/","yes_rsvp_count":35,"name":"Damian Conway at Scotsman: Don't change languages.

You don’t have to start out in Perl 6 writing autoparallelized infinite superpositions of multimorphic higher-order functions. You don’t even have to statically type your variables or encapsulate your objects.</p> <p>For most Perl developers, the real and immediate benefit of using Perl 6 is this new (but eerily familiar) programming language just plain eliminates most of the minor annoyances and frustrations that plague our everyday coding.</p> <p>If you’ve ever mistyped a sigil, miscounted a subroutine’s parameters, mis-used the spooky action-at-a-distance of $_, mis-sorted a numeric list, mis-indented a heredoc, mis-interpolated a variable, mis-typed a regex, or simply misunderstood a sequence of nested subroutine calls, Perl 6 has a kinder, gentler solution for you.</p> <p>This talk explores some of the most useful, convenient, and un-scary ways in which Perl 6 improves on Perl 5 and offers a dozen practical reasons why Perl 6 might now be a better choice as your everyday go-to problem-solver.<b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Presenter bio:</b></p> <p><br/>Damian Conway is an internationally renowned speaker, author, and trainer, and a prominent contributor to the Perl community.

Along the way, the CS student should also learn how to program competently in (at least) the imperative, object-oriented, and functional paradigms.</p> <p>To teach all these concepts and techniques it is usually necessary to resort to a wide range of different programming languages from the 1950's (Lisp and Fortran), the 1960's (Forth), the 1970's (Smalltalk, C, Scheme), the 1980's (C++, Perl, Occam), the 1990's (Haskell, Java, JavaScript), and the 2000's (C#, Scala, Clojure). This diversity certainly gives the student a wider repertoire, but also encourages an unfortunate (and unnecessary) internal compartmentalization of concepts and approaches.</p> <p>Perl 6 is a new language in the Perl family, which aims to provide all of the major features of all of the major languages from all three dominant paradigms. It offers everything from low-level bitwise operations on raw bytes, to a full range of built-in system commands, to hygenic source code macros, to direct symbol-table introspection and manipulation, to run-time composition of multiply dispatched multimethods from mixins, to object-oriented grammars with hybrid DFA/NFA rules, to concurrent higher-order functions applied over infinite lists of pipelined arbitrary precision integers.</p> <p>In other words, we stole the best features from 20 different languages, and then spent a decade working out how to put them together in a way that is clean, efficient, powerful, and still usable by actual human beings. And Perl 6 was the result.</p> <p>In this presentation, Dr Damian Conway (one of the principle designers of Perl 6) will discuss some of the more interesting features of the language and demonstrate how it might be of value in an integrated Computer Science curriculum. <b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Presenter bio:</b></p> <p>Damian Conway holds a B.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Computer Science.</p> <p>A widely sought-after speaker and educator, he is also the author of numerous well-known Open Source software modules and several technical books on the Perl 5 programming language.</p> <p>He has been a working academic in Australia since 1986, and from 2000 to 2010 was an Adjunct Associate Professor with the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University.</p> <p>He currently runs an international IT training company that provides programmer and speaker training throughout Europe, North America, and Australasia.</p> <p>Technical and academic areas in which he has published internationally include: programming language design, programmer education, object orientation, software engineering, natural language generation, synthetic language generation, emergent systems, declarative programming, image morphing, human-computer interaction, geometric modelling, the psychophysics of perception, nanoscale simulation, and parsing.</p> <p><i>Arranged in collaboration with <a href=\"http://sonen.ifi.uio.no/events/Damian-Conway\">Åpen Sone for Informatikk</a> @ UiO.</i></p>","how_to_find_us":"We're upstairs!","event_url":"https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/172566472/","yes_rsvp_count":19,"duration":6300000,"name":"Perl 6: A Programming Language for Computer Scientists (And Other Crazy People)","id":"172566472","time":1396019700000,"updated":1396080552000,"group":{"join_mode":"open","created":1390249006000,"name":"Oslo.pm","group_lon":10.75,"id":12310682,"urlname":"Oslo-pm","group_lat":59.90999984741211,"who":"Perl Mongers"},"status":"past"},{"utc_offset":3600000,"venue":{"country":"no","localized_country_name":"Norway","city":"Oslo","address_1":"Karl Johansgt 17","name":"Scotsman, 2. etg","lon":10.743448,"id":1566359,"lat":59.912659,"repinned":false},"rsvp_limit":150,"headcount":0,"visibility":"public","waitlist_count":0,"created":1394185042000,"rating":{"count":6,"average":4.670000076293945},"maybe_rsvp_count":0,"description":"<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/7/d/6/600_339386582.jpeg\" /></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2014/03/what-goes-around-comes-around.html\">Damian Conway</a> of Perl fame, is kind enough to pay us a visit yet again, this time with a talk about Life, the Universe, and Everything.
