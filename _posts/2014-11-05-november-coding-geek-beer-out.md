November beer &amp; geekery!

It&#39;s time for a visit to Handverkerstuene! Good time to geek out a little, talk about the upcoming London and Nordic Perl Workshops, and next year&#39;s big event in Oslo, OSDC.

OSDC is open for *all* kind of Open Source communities, technical communities and meetup groups, so if you&#39;re curious and want to help us make something happen, feel free to sign up and drop by! :D

<br>If you can&#39;t find us, call Salve on[masked] 35.
