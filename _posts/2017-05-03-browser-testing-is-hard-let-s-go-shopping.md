Hello Perl Mongers,

Next meeting will have a technical talk given by Jan Henning Thorsen, followed by trip to a local bar for beers and chat.

Place: Reisegiganten, Rosenkrantz&#39; gate 9. Ring the doorbell and we&#39;ll let you in.

Time: 3rd of May, 18:30

The name of the talk is &quot;Browser testing is hard. Let&#39;s go shopping&quot;. It will give an introduction to how you can test any web application live in your browser using a Perl module called Test::Mojo::Role::Selenium.

The talk will give an introduction to:

• The module interface<br>• Testing any web page<br>• Testing a Mojolicious based application<br>• Tricks on event based programming

Looking forward to seeing you there!
