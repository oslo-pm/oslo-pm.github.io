We have created a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/111405942135977171778/111405942135977171778/posts?pageId=111405942135977171778">Google+</a> profile and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgk2wCZr5Rk-cewLTtQA_Fg">YouTube</a> channel for the conference presentations. Most of the presentations are already uploaded, but there are some waiting for confirmation.

If your don&#39;t know what happened with your presentation, then please <a href="mailto:mojoconf@oslo.pm">let us know</a> and we will try to fix it.

We want to say thank you to <a href="http://www.nuug.no/">NUUG</a>, which made it possible to record and distribute the presentations.

The YouTube edit of the videos were created with <a href="https://github.com/jhthorsen/snippets/blob/master/media/avconv-maketalk">perl + avconv + imagemagick</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgk2wCZr5Rk-cewLTtQA_Fg">Check out the videos!</a></p></div>
