</ul>

<p>Marcus Ramberg invites Oslo.pm to his &quot;Noworking&quot; co-working facility at Nordaaker, where he&#39;s going to help us go through all the steps of creating a web application with Mojolicious. Bring your laptop!</p>

<p>We&#39;ll be looking at all the steps for creating a proper web application with Mojolicious, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making a super-quick prototype with Mojo::Lite</li>
  <li>How routing and rendering works</li>
  <li>Web Sockets, and what you can do with it in Mojo</li>
  <li>How to make use of NoSQL stores like Redis in your app</li>
  <li>Test-driven development with Mojo::Test</li>
  <li>Deployment strategies</li>
  <li>...and more!</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be a hands-on evening with Marcus showing us good ways for developing the app, and the rest of us following his example on our own laptops. Jan Henning has offered to help too! :)</p>

<p>To join the fun, please bring the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your laptop</li>
  <li>Installed with Perl v5.14 or newer (We recommend App::perlbrew - <a href="http://perlbrew.pl">http://perlbrew.pl</a>)</li>
  <li>Your brain and your good humour :)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
