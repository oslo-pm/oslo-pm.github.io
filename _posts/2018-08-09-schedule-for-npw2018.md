We are very grateful for all the good submissions to the Nordic Perl Workshop
this year, and we're proud to present the schedule at
[npw2018.oslo.pm/npw2018/schedule](https://npw2018.oslo.pm/npw2018/schedule).

If you still want to give a talk, we might be able to squeeze you in either on
Friday or as a lightning talk. Don't hesitate to contact us, if you have
something you want to share with the community.
