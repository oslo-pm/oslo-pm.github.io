Next year, we&#39;d love to see another Mojoconf organized!

To help this happen, the Mojoconf 2014 organizers donate â‚¬2000 to the next year&#39;s organizers. If you would like to organize it, state your interest publicly in the #mojo IRC channel on irc.perl.org; The Mojolicious core team gets to figure out who wins the honor! :)

Thanks for a great conference, and we hope to see everyone at the hackathon on Sunday, and if not; then at next year&#39;s Mojoconf!

Cheers!
