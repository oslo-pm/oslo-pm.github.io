After a successful conference day, we will meet up at Kulturhuset, literally around the corner of the venue, for socializing, drinks and food. We have reserved 40 seats, so we should have enough space.

The venue is quite large, and it contains ping-pong and shuffleboard tables if anyone wants to spend some excess energy

Kulturhuset sells mostly beverages, and some sanwiches in the caf\e area, but they allow people to bring food from elsewhere to eat it there. The fish &#39;n&#39; chips from Fiskeriet next door are really nice.
