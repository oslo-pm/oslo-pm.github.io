Michael Schwern tells us about the seven principles of making difficult tasks simple. Each principle will be illustrated first using a physical example, then an example in a computer user interface and finally it will be shown applied directly to programming.

The seven principles are:

<ul><li>Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head</li>
<li>Simplify the structure of tasks</li>
<li>Make things visible</li>
<li>Get the mappings right</li>
<li>Exploit the power of constraints</li>
<li>Design for error</li>
<li>When all else fails, standardize</li></ul>
