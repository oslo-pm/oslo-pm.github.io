* When: Dec 2 18:30
* Where: [Gaasa, Storgata 36B](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Storgata+36B%2C+Oslo%2C+NO)
* Join us at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/227132759/)

Again, we&#39;ll meet at Gaasa for a $beverage and look back on what happened in 2015. We&#39;ll also discuss the imminent release of Rakudo Perl 6.0.0.

For next month&#39;s meetup, on Jan. 6., we want a technical talk or three. I will book a room at Teknologihuset. Please tell me if you have something to show us all in a month&#39;s time!
