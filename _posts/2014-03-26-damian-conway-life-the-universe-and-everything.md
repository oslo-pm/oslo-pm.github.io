<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/2014/03/what-goes-around-comes-around.html">Damian Conway</a> of Perl fame, is kind enough to pay us a visit yet again, this time with a talk about Life, the Universe, and Everything. Damian is an enticing speaker no matter the topic and this time he will guide us through a journey in time and space.

<b>Abstract:</b>

<i>Take a mind-altering journey to the outer limits of programming as Damian explores:</i>

• <i>The unlikely convenience of quantum finite state automata<br></i>

• <i>The demonic power of Maxwell&#39;s information engine<br></i>

• <i>The computational expressiveness of (un)natural languages</i>

<i>...blending them all into a simple self-describing massively parallel auto-visualizing superpositional proof-by-simulation system that spans six centuries of the computational arts.</i> <b><br></b>

<b>Wait, what?</b>

<br>Last time he was in Oslo, Damain gave the talk <i>&quot;Temporally Quaquaversal Virtual Nanomachine Programming In Multiple Topologically Connected Quantum-Relativistic Parallel Timespaces...Made Easy!&quot;</i>. Here&#39;s a taste of the talk to give you an idea of what to expect:

<br><b>Food &amp; drink:</b>

Doors open at 17:00-ish for those who want to come early to get good seating and some food and drink before the event.

<b>Welcome! :D</b>
