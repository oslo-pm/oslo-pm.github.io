## Presenting Mojolicious Nine Point Oh!

In this presentation, Mojolicious Core Team member Joel Berger will discuss
some of the features of the recent Mojolicious 9.0 release and how they can
improve your web (and async) applications.


The first part of this meeting will be streamed and published on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiGxe3wYhD8).

The second part of this meetup (when we're done with the above part), we
will continue with a closed session where the participants at the meetup
can join the conversation with Joel! This is a great opportunity to learn
new tips and tricks on this topic from one of the most experienced Perl
developers out there. _This part will not be streamed or published, and is
only available to registered participants._

Access to the second part is given to those who [sign up on our meetup page]({{page.event_url}}).


# COVID-19 Considerations & maximum participants

Due to the current COVID-19 situation in Oslo, we will be conducting this
meetup online only. There is no maximum limit to the online participation.
Make sure to sign up!


# About...

Joel Berger is a Mojolicious Core Team member. He has a Ph.D. in
Instrumentation Physics from the University of Illinois at Chicago and

## - Oslo Perl Mongers, the organizer

[Oslo.pm](https://oslo.pm) is Norway's largest network of developers who use
Perl, CPAN, Raku and related technologies and communities. We're Open Source
participants, open to both experienced and new members. If you or your
company depend on the Perl, CPAN or Raku ecosystems, this is the community
where you want to be.

## Yourself, the participant

You are interested in Perl, web publishing, Mojolicious or async programming,
and would like to get the latest take on these topics. If your company
depends on Mojolicous, but you don't have much time to follow everything
closely, then this meeting may be for you!

## Preparations

Beyond setting up the usual tools for online participation (eg. sitting in
a quiet environment, listening with headphones and having a decent
microphone), no other preparations are required. We do recommend you check
out the following, though:

* Read "[Announcing Mojolicious 9.0](https://mojolicious.io/blog/2021/02/14/announcing-mojolicious-9-0/)"

And finally, *Please stay safe!*
