Staying around after the [Nordic Perl Workshop and
Mojoconf](http://oslo.pm/npw2018)? We'll arrange a hackathon on Saturday, so
you can meet fellow Perl-hackers, team up or ask for input.

* Venue: Reisegiganten AS
* When: 8th of September, 11:00
* Where: [Rosenkrantz' gate 9](https://goo.gl/maps/jWQMZqe7PfA2)

Might be a bit tricky to find the door, but there's a passage way going between
two buildings, with some construction on the left side of the entrance. Walk to
the middle of the passage and ring the doorbell to get in or ask in
[#oslo.pm](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.perl.org/#oslo.pm?nick=npw-guest-?),
and we'll let you in.

We have also set up a Telegram group
"[Mojolicious (MojoConf/NPW](https://t.me/perlmojo)" you can reach us in.
