Regular social meetup, but we will discuss a few things:

Damian Conway will be in Oslo 18-21 April, and can hold courses and one of his regular evening talks. We will discuss and plan.

Do you have a Perl-related talk you could hold in one of our upcoming first wednesday meetings? Or know someone who you think should hold a talk? Please come and tell us!
