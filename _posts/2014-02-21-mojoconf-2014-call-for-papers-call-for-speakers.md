As previously announced the first Mojolicious related conference ever, Mojoconf 2014, will be hosted by Oslo.pm in Oslo, Norway during the weekend of May 23rd to 25th.

A big part of the conference will be Saturday&#39;s presentations. This will be the only day for presentations as Friday will have a course, and Sunday is reserved for a hackathon session.

We would like to invite anyone that wants to hold a talk related to Mojolicious, Perl and the web. In addition we will have a smaller track with related technologies, so we welcome talks about related technologies such as javascript frameworks like Angular or React.js, storage solutions like MongoDB or Redis, or web technologies like Varnish and Nginx.

Do you have a good story, some specific technology you have used, a particular product you have made, breakthroughs or even failures, don&#39;t hesitate in submitting your talk.

We are aiming for talks lasting either 20 minutes or 40 minutes, but we are flexible in length or presentation form, please contact us for more information. If you&#39;re interested in holding a shorter talk, send us a note, we might hold a lightening talks session as well.

The deadline for submitting talks is set to <strike>March 15th</strike> April 5th.

If your talk is accepted, you will of course get free admission to the event.
