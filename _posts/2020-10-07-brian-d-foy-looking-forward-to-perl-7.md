# How will the transition to Perl 7 go?

We have invited _brian d foy_ to speak about the upcoming major release
of Perl! He'll give us dive into the rationale behind this release, what

The presentation will be done online and later published on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMg7ia28fvx6iN08QR_-ig/videos).
