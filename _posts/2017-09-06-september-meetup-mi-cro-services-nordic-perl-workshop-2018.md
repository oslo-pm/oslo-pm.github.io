Summer is over and it&#39;s time to talk about Perl again.

1. Jonathan Worthington and Edument have made a Perl 6 web/microservice framework called Cro. We take a quick look at it with a little live demo by K. Rune Nilsen. More info at <a href="http://mi.cro.services">mi.cro.services</a>, and Jonathan&#39;s talk from the Swiss Perl Workshop is <a href="https://youtu.be/6CsBDnTUJ3A">here</a>.

2. Some of us want to try to organize a Nordic Perl Workshop and a Mojoconf next year. There is also some funding available from OSDC and NUUG. We talk about the possibilities, and what our needs are for this to become a reality. Please show up if you might be interested in helping out!

Afterwards we go out for a beer.
