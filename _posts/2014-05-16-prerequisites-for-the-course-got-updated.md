The prerequisites for the course got updated:

<blockquote>Students are recommended to bring laptops running OSX or Linux. Windows will work for much of the labs, although high performance examples may not operate as expected.
<p>Please arrive with Perl 5.16.3+, Mojolicious 4.98+, App::cpanminus and Modern::Perl installed. For those using earlier versions of Perl, http://perlbrew.pl is recommended. Please contact us if you have questions or need help arriving prepared.</p></blockquote>
