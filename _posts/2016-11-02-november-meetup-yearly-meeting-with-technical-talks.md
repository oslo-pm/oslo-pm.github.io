18:00 Yearly meeting

19:00 Talk 1: Re-implementing <a href="http://api.met.no">api.met.no</a> in a modern web framework - Geir Aalberg

<br><a href="http://api.met.no">api.met.no</a> was introduced in 2007 to deliver meteorological data to <a href="http://yr.no">yr.no</a>, but is also used by government agencies, public companies and mobile apps. After ten years of &quot;if it works, don&#39;t fix it&quot; it is given a facelift, new functionality, better performance, continuous integration and vastly improved testing. Did anyone mention Scala?

<br>ca 19:30 Talk 2: DBIx::TempDB: Mocking a database sucks. Use the real deal - Jan Henning Thorsen (batman)

Live-coding the Mojolicious Blog example using DBIx::TempDB

<br>ca 20:00-20:30 We go out for beer and maybe some food.
