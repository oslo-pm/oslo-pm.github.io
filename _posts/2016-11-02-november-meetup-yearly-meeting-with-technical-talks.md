19:00 Talk 1: Re-implementing <a href="http://api.met.no">api.met.no</a> in a modern web framework - Geir Aalberg

<br><a href="http://api.met.no">api.met.no</a> was introduced in 2007 to deliver meteorological data to <a href="http://yr.no">yr.no</a>, but is also used by government agencies, public companies and mobile apps. After ten years of &quot;if it works, don&#39;t fix it&quot; it is given a facelift, new functionality, better performance, continuous integration and vastly improved testing. Did anyone mention Scala?
