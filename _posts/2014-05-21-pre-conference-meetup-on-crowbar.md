The pre-conference meetup will be at Crowbar, a micro brewery just five minutes from the venue. Look for table signes with &quot;Mojoconf&quot; on them, or look for fellow Mojo-hackers.

Time: Friday, 23rd of May, 17:30
<br>Address: Torggata 32.
<br>Food: You can get small snacks and kebab. (I recommend the kebab)
