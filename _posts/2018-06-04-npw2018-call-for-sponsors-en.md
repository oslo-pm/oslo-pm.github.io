Being a [Partner](https://github.com/oslo-pm/NPW2018/issues/6) for this
conference is a good way to present your brand positively to the attendees,
enabling you to build up your company's image within the Perl community.

We would like to help you create a meaningful relationship, providing you with
opportunities not only for advertising, but for making contacts and even
recruiting.

We have three partner packages; Bronze (at 1.000€), Silver (at 2.000€), and
Gold (at 5.000€).

All partners get their logo with link on our web site. Bronze and Silver
partners can place a banner (type
[L-Banner](https://www.mitostudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/110112-Premier-Pull-Up-Floor-Banners-1865_LR1024.jpg)
with maximum width 100cm and height 220cm) at the venue. Gold partners can
also get a table for presentations etc. during the whole conference.

Should you have any questions, feedback, or if you have already decided to
sponsor NPW or mojoconf please [contact us](/npw2018/info#contact) by sending
an email to [{{d.contact.email}}](mailto:{{d.contact.email}}).
