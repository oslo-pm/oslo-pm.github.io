In the week after the NPW and the Perl 6/EPO Hackathon, on April 21-24th 2009, <a href="http://szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a> will be teaching his course on Test Automation. It is based on the 3-day course given in 2008 (right after the Perl QA Hackathon), but has since then been expanded to 4 days.

The training will take place in the class-rooms of <a href="http://www.redpill-linpro.no/">Redpill-Linpro</a> - the same venue as the Perl 6/EPO Hackathon. For further details, see <a href="http://szabgab.com/blog/2009/01/1232302278.html">Gabor&#39;s announcement</a> and the <a href="http://oslo.pm.org/kurs.shtml">course introduction</a> (in norwegian) at the Oslo.pm website.

Part of the income will go to support/sponsor a Perl project (to be announced later.) Last year the course generated enough income so Gabor could offer a grant to <a href="http://ali.as/">Adam Kennedy</a> for his &quot;<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/2008/05/2008q2_grant_proposal_perl_on.html">Perl on a Stick</a>&quot; project.

This event is separate from the Nordic Perl Workshop.
Registration and payments are handled directly by Gabor &lt;szabgab@gmail.com&gt;.
