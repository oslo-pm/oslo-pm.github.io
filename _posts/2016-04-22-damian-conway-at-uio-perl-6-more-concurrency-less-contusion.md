The renowned speaker, instructor and communicator, and co-designer of the Perl 6 language, Damian Conway, will hold a talk on Friday 22. April at UiO/USIT at 16:00. It will be at the large auditorium in Kristen Nygaards House (the old IFI building).

<i><b>Perl 6: More Concurrency, Less Contusion</b></i>

<br><i>Unlike most other popular programming languages, Perl 6 was specifically designed and implemented to facilitate and support a wide range of concurrency models and programming techniques.<br></i>

<i>The language has numerous built-in constructs that allow its compiler to automatically infer and implement concurrency without the developer needing to specify it explicitly (or in some cases, without the developer needing to even be aware of the possibility).<br></i>

<i>Perl 6 also provides a clean and composable model for explicit concurrency, when you need it. A model that helps developers avoid most of the common problems explicit scheduling and synchronization, shared memory consistency, pool management, re-entrant locking, guard coordination, starvation, race conditions, livelock, or deadlock.<br></i>

<i>In this presentation, Dr Damian Conway (one of the core designers of the new Perl language) will explain and demonstrate the central ideas and the diverse range of tools for concurrent programming in Perl 6.</i>

If endlessly wrestling with threads or events or callbacks in your current implementation language has ever given you an emotional bruising or a mental black eye, then you&#39;re in for a much more pleasant surprise with Perl 6. Expect more scalability with less code, more concurrency with less management, more solution with less contusion.

The talk is free of charge and open for all.

On the Wednesday before, Damian will hold a talk for the Oslo Perl Mongers: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/230165754/">Damian Conway at Scotsman: Don&#39;t change languages. Change your language!</a>
