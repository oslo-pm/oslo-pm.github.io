* When: {{page.when | date: site.event_date_format }}
* Where: [{{page.where}}]({{site.maps_url}}{{page.maps_query}})
* Join us at [Meetup]({{page.event_url}})

We&#39;ll find an outside table and talk about upcoming Perl events and whatever else tickles our fancies.

YAPC in Sofia is just around the corner. We&#39;ll also test whether we can manage to arrange an OSDC (Open Source Developers&#39; Conference) together with other OS communities.

Also, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/07/cpan-day---14th-august.html">CPAN day is on the 16. of August</a>!

Interested? Come join us!
