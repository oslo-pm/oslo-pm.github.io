* When: Aug 6 18:30
* Where: [Gaasa, Storgata 36B](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Storgata+36B%2C+Oslo%2C+NO)
* Join us at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-pm/events/199092482/)

We&#39;ll find an outside table and talk about upcoming Perl events and whatever else tickles our fancies.

YAPC in Sofia is just around the corner. We&#39;ll also test whether we can manage to arrange an OSDC (Open Source Developers&#39; Conference) together with other OS communities.

Also, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/07/cpan-day---14th-august.html">CPAN day is on the 16. of August</a>!

Interested? Come join us!
