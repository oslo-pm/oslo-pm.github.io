Thanks to everyone who has submitted a talk before the deadline. We would still like to get more speakers, and have decided to <strong>extend the deadline by one week</strong>, until January 18. 2009, 23:59 CET.

In an effort to attract new speakers, we have also decided to open up for <strong>20 minute talks</strong> in addition to the earlier announced 45 minute and 90 minute slots. Submit your talk today!
