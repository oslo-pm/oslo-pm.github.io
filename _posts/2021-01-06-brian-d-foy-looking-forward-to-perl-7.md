[This meeting was initially postponed due to brian being summoned to
fight forest fires in the US North-West, and later due to stricter
Covid-19 rules in Oslo. We apologize for this inconvenience]

## How may we prepare for Perl 7?

We have invited _brian d foy_ to speak about the upcoming major release
of Perl! With us, he'll make dive into the rationale behind this release,
what to expect and how to transition your own codebase to the new version.

The first part of this meeting will be done online and later published on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMg7ia28fvx6iN08QR_-ig/videos).

The second part of this meetup (when we're done with the above part), we
will continue with a closed session where the participants at the meetup
can join the conversation with brian! This is a great opportunity to learn
new tips and tricks on this topic from one of the most experienced Perl
developers out there. _This part will not be streamed or published._

Access to the second part is given to those who [sign up on our meetup page]({{page.event_url}}).
