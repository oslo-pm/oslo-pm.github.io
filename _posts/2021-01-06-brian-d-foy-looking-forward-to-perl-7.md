[This meeting was initially postponed due to brian being summoned to
fight forest fires in the US North-West, and later due to stricter
Covid-19 rules in Oslo. We apologize for this inconvenience]

## How may we prepare for Perl 7?

We have invited _brian d foy_ to speak about the upcoming major release
of Perl! With us, he'll make dive into the rationale behind this release,
what to expect and how to transition your own codebase to the new version.

The first part of this meeting will be done online and later published on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqMg7ia28fvx6iN08QR_-ig/videos).

The second part of this meetup (when we're done with the above part), we
will continue with a closed session where the participants at the meetup
can join the conversation with brian! This is a great opportunity to learn
new tips and tricks on this topic from one of the most experienced Perl
developers out there. _This part will not be streamed or published, and is
only available to registered participants._

Access to the second part is given to those who [sign up on our meetup page]({{page.event_url}}).


# COVID-19 Considerations & maximum participants

Due to the current COVID-19 situation in Oslo, we will be conducting this
meetup online only. There is no maximum limit to the online participation.
Make sure to sign up!


# About...

## - brian d foy, the speaker

brian is a prolific author of many well-known books on Perl and Raku, and
has been a cornerstone in the Perl community for well over two decades.
His books have introduced Perl to thousands of developers, and he is still
active writing about Perl and Raku and offering training classes to both
beginning and experienced developers.

brian is preparing his 8th edition of the seminal _Learning Perl_ book, and
is currently working on a [guide for transitioning from Perl 5 to 7](https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7).


## - Oslo Perl Mongers, the organizer

[Oslo.pm](https://oslo.pm) is Norway's largest network of developers who use
Perl, CPAN, Raku and related technologies and communities. We're Open Source
participants, open to both experienced and new members. If you or your
company depend on the Perl, CPAN or Raku ecosystems, this is the community
where you want to be.

## Yourself, the participant

You are interested in the future of Perl, but may not have spent much time
on following the minutia around this topic. If your company depends on Perl,
but you don't have much time to follow everything closely, then this meeting
may be for you!

## Preparations

Beyond setting up the usual tools for online participation (eg. sitting in a quiet environment,
listening with headphones and having a decent microphone), no other preparations are required.
We do recommend you check out the following, though:

* Read "[Announcing Perl 7](https://www.perl.com/article/announcing-perl-7/)"
* Optionally, buy and read "[Preparing for Perl 7](https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7)"
* Check out brian's offerings on [Perl School](https://perlschool.com/).
* Bring your greatest worries about Perl 7, so we can help you solve them!

And finally, *Please stay safe!*
